Joomantic

This repository contains an empty boilerplate Joomla 4/5 template (theme) that incorporates the Fomantic-UI fork (https://fomantic-ui.com) of the Semantic-UI CSS framework (https://semantic-ui.com) that 
was originally developed by Jack Lukic.

The template that I developed makes it easy for developers to convert and translate static websites that were built in either Semantic-UI or Fomantic-UI over to the Joomla CMS.
